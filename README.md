#### Loading the dataset (Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity) Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset (CIC-IDS2017)
- Website Link for Dataset: [Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset (CIC-IDS2017)](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)
##### CICIDS2017 dataset contains benign and the most up-to-date common attacks, which resembles the true real-world data (PCAPs). It also includes [the results of the network traffic analysis](https://github.com/ahlashkari/CICFlowMeter) using CICFlowMeter with labeled flows based on the time stamp, source, and destination IPs, source and destination ports, protocols and attack (CSV files).

#### Workflow that is used in this Project
- Data Processing (ETL, Wrangling)
- Data Normalization
